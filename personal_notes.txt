1st Slide:
- # Efficient Feature Envy Detection and Refactoring Based on Graph Neural Network
- Keywords:
    - Technical Debt(TD): the implied cost of additional work in the future resulting from 
    choosing an expedient solution over a more robust one in software development.
    - Code smell: serious form of TD which is confusing, complex, or harmful design patters 
    in source code
    - Feature Envy: most common code smell. Refers to a method that is more interested in an 
    external class than its enclosing class. Misplaced method. 
    - SMOTE Call Graph (SCG): a GNN based approach to address the problems of detecting and 
    refactoring feature envy.
    - Calling Strength: is a concept that quantifies the strength of method invocations in the 
    call graph
    - Symmetric Feature Fusion Learning (SFFL): Obtains graphical representations of methods-classes. 
    Another approach to address the problems of detecting and refactoring feature envy. 
    - Invocation: number of times method is called
    - Ownership: the class which the method belongs to
    - Position: where the method is located in the code.
    - Coupling: a class A is coupled with class B if A affects B and vice versa.

- Introduction and Background:
    Feature Envy, the most common type of code smell, which is a form of TD,
        - reduces the cohesion of its own class
        - increases the coupling between classes. It's always better to have 
        less coupling.
    Best way to Handle it: 
        Move the feature envy method to the class from which it calls too many
        methods from.
