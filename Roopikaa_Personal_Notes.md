**INTRODUCTION**

Feature Envy is one of the most common code smells and a major form of Technical Debt (TD). TD is basically the extra work that builds up later when developers take shortcuts instead of opting for a better, long-term solution. With Feature Envy, you’ve got a method in one class that relies too much on another class. This ends up lowering the cohesion of the class and increasing coupling between the two. Coupling means that changes in one class directly affect the other, which makes the code harder to maintain. The goal is always to keep coupling low, so the code stays more flexible and easier to manage.

To fix Feature Envy, the best approach is to simply move the method to the class it’s so dependent on. Doing this improves the design, strengthens the cohesion of the classes, and reduces the unnecessary connections between them.
